Title: Earth at Night - A Scientific Overview

The phenomenon of Earth at night offers a fascinating view into both natural and artificial illumination across the globe.
From space, astronauts aboard the International Space Station can observe lightning storms, auroras, wildfires, and city lights.
These nighttime lights are more than just visually stunning—they reveal critical data about energy usage, population density,
economic development, and human impact on the environment. NASA’s Earth Observatory and NOAA satellites have consistently
monitored nighttime imagery for decades, supporting research in urban growth, light pollution, and disaster response.

Auroras, or polar lights, are caused by solar wind interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.
Meanwhile, human-made lights often follow roads, coastlines, and political boundaries, allowing observers to clearly see
patterns of civilization. In developing regions, expanding light patterns over time may indicate improving infrastructure,
while sudden outages can reveal natural disasters or energy crises.

This overview serves as an essential resource for understanding the significance of the Earth’s nocturnal appearance.

Q: What causes the auroras visible from space?
A: Auroras are caused by solar wind interacting with Earth’s magnetic field and upper atmosphere.

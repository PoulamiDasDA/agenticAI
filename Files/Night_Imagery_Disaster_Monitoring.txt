Title: Nighttime Imagery in Climate and Disaster Monitoring

Satellite-based nighttime observations are increasingly important in climate science and emergency response.
During power outages caused by hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes, a sudden drop in light levels can help
authorities identify the hardest-hit areas even when other communications are down.

In wildfire-prone areas like California or Australia, nighttime satellite images can detect active fires via thermal signatures,
tracking their spread through smoke and darkness. These technologies support quicker deployment of emergency services and
improve early-warning systems.

Climate researchers also study nighttime heat retention in urban environments, known as the "urban heat island" effect.
Cities often remain warmer overnight than rural areas, increasing energy demand for cooling and affecting public health.

Q: How does night imagery support disaster response?
A: It identifies blackout zones, detects fire outbreaks, and helps guide emergency operations when ground access is limited.

Q: What is the urban heat island effect?
A: It's the tendency for cities to retain more heat overnight compared to rural areas due to concrete and reduced vegetation.

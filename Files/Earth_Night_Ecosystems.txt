Title: Earth's Nighttime Ecosystems

While much of human focus at night revolves around city lights and satellites, Earth's ecosystems undergo critical changes after dark.
Nocturnal animals—from owls and bats to fireflies and jaguars—come alive, relying on darkness for hunting, mating, and avoiding predators.
Light pollution from urban areas threatens the natural rhythms of these animals, disrupting sleep cycles, migration patterns, and reproduction.

In the oceans, bioluminescent creatures such as plankton and jellyfish light up the dark water with an eerie glow,
producing light through chemical reactions. These underwater lights serve as communication signals, camouflage, or lures for prey.

Researchers use night-vision cameras, acoustic sensors, and satellite imagery to study these phenomena and assess how human-generated
light affects biodiversity and the food chain.

Q: What is bioluminescence and how does it help marine life?
A: Bioluminescence is the production of light by living organisms, used for communication, camouflage, and attracting prey.

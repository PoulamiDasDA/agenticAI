Title: Human Activity Seen from Space at Night

Artificial illumination visible from orbit provides a unique lens to study human presence and development.
Major metropolitan areas such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo emit powerful light signatures that can be seen clearly from orbit.
Conversely, areas like North Korea appear almost dark compared to neighboring regions, reflecting differences in infrastructure
and energy availability.

Light intensity and expansion patterns help researchers identify urban sprawl, deforestation, and electrification trends.
Monitoring lights also plays a role in humanitarian efforts. For example, changes in nighttime brightness have been used
to assess refugee camp populations or damage after natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes.

Q: How does night imagery help humanitarian efforts?
A: Satellite-detected changes in light patterns help estimate populations, monitor disaster zones, and evaluate reconstruction progress.

Q: Why is North Korea darker than South Korea at night?
A: Due to limited infrastructure and electricity availability, North Korea has significantly less artificial lighting than its southern neighbor.
